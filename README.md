# TriviaGame


* Trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, the screen changes congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, displays the next question -- without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  * If the player runs out of time, the screen shows that time's up and displays the correct answer. Waits a few seconds, then shows the next question.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, the screen shows that the player selected the wrong option and displays the correct answer. Waits a few seconds, then show the next question.

* On the final screen shows the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game.
